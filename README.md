# Convolutional-Neural-Network
Summary of some CNN architecture and their applications

* In this post, I will sumarize some main categories about CNN and some CNN-based networks. Particularly, in this post, I will construct and compare the results trained by VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50 networks for Object Regconition problem. 

* **1. About Convolutional Neural Network**

Convolutional neural network (ConvNets or CNNs) is one of the main categories to do images recognition, images classifications. Objects detections, recognition faces etc., are some of the areas where CNNs are widely used.

CNNs are particularly useful for finding patterns in images to recognize objects, faces, and scenes. They learn directly from image data, using patterns to classify images and eliminating the need for manual feature extraction.

* **2. CNN's architecture**

a. Convolution Layer

Convolution Layer is the first layer to extract features from an input image. Convolution preserves the relationship between pixels by learning image features using small squares of input data. It is a mathematical operation that takes two inputs such as image matrix and a filter or kernel.
